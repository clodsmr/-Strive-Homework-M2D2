ASSIGNMENT TOPIC
You are creating a website to showcase your favourite music albums.
In this page you will have a short biography section of yourself, the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listened to and everything related to the music you love.

ASSIGNMENT RULES
- The project must be pushed to a new repository and linked in EduFlow by the end of the day.
- You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material provided and documentation.
- To test the page, open it with your browser and inspect it with developer tools / device emulator.
- Use Bootstrap4.6 classes to create the page.
- Use containers, rows and cols in order to achieve a great responsive layout.

NOTE:
Even the most experienced designers need inspiration.
Spend some time surfing the web researching the best way of representing the albums you love.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or any other music collection out there.

HINT: Manage your time in order to finish the structure and responsiveness before focusing on the details.

        /* EXERCISE 1
            For every Album we'd like to have a consistent style.
            Therefore you should create a class for each of the following elements:
            - The album container
            - The album cover
            - The album title
            - The album group / singer / dj
            - The album genre
            - The album duration
            - etc

            ...to make sure you give every album the same consistent appearance.

    <!-- EXERCISE 2 
            Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component
            This navigation bar must link every section in your page.

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
            Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.
            In this section you should have:
            - 4 albums per row when the screen is very large
            - 3 albums per row when you are on a tablet (or a smaller viewport)
            - 2 albums per row when you are on a small screen

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
            Create a section for the album reviews.
            Pick one of your favourite albums, and create a section with:
            - Cover
            - Title
            - Band
            - Duration
            - Genre
            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!

                <h1> Cleopatra </h1>
                <h2> The lumineers </h2>
                 <p> A very interesting thing about this album is that the songs are linked one to another in a story-telling way, in the videoclips we can see hints about hte story since the songs were released backwards
    
                 </p>
        </div>
           <div class="col-6">

           </div>
        </div>

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Choose the albums you dislike or some you think are overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart! 
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are a fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them!
            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "squared" (use CSS to achieve that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice tapestry effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links.
        -->
    <div class="container">
        <footer>
            my socials
        </footer>
    </div>
    <!-- ############ EXTRA:
        EXERCISE 9
            Create an album details area which will be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible).
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it)
        -->

    <!--
         EXERCISE 11
            Add in the footer a field that counts, on page load, how many ALBUMS are present on the page.
